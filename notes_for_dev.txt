Delet icon should not delete it immadiatelly, should ask for confirmation.

Centralise cancel and confirm button style in modals.
Focus on textarea when clicked add comment icon

Move StatusBadge into UI

What if the status acidentally changed? How to redo it?

Would be more logical to call collection info instead of lorry info
